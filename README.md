# Crusader Words
A web app to play crosswords. Best played on a mobile device.

Optimized for American-style (e.g. New York Times) crosswords, currently incompatible with _exotic_ features and non-square grids.

[Play it here!](https://ker0chan.github.io/crusader-words/)

You will need a .puz file (Across Lite format) to start playing, (TODO: Add a link to some free resources here.)

**Tip**: Use the "Add to homescreen" button in your mobile browser to hide the browser interface!

## Customization
You can easily host your own copy of Crusader Words - just put the folder on a local server or hosted website, and point to index.html. Take this opportunity to edit the color scheme in index.js, change the keyboard layout in VirtualKeyboard.js, or add other cool tweaks!

## TODO
* Keyboard: Haptic feedback on keypress
* Keyboard: Different layouts (AZERTY, BEPO, DVORAK...)
* Save current progress across multiple grids (!)
* Pencil mode
* Timer
* Check cell/word/grid
* Autocheck mode (check each cell as it's filled in)
* Check answers when grid is filled, react accordingly
* Reveal cell/word/grid
* Display puzzle information (author, description, copyright)
* Highlight linked answers ("See 12-Across, ...")
* Progress milestones (`Halfway done! *\(n_n)/*`)
* Whatever rebuses are (rebus? rebi?)
* Customisation (color scheme, margins/borders, fonts...)
* Provide sample grids (e.g. a simple mini on first launch)
* Multiplayer mode???
